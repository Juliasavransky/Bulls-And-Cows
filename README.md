   You need to guess a 4 digits number.
            The number can't include 0, 
            and each digit can be used only once. 
            If you got the right digit and placed it in the right position,
            that's called a Bull and you will see the digit in that position. If
            you got the right digit but placed it in the WRONG position, that
            calls a Cow and you will see the letter C in that position. If you
            didn't got it right you will see _ in that position.
